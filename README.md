SeatTreat wants to provide you with a tool to enhance uncomfortable and unpleasant circumstances you might encounter at your seat in the airplane.

SeatTreatâ€™s native iOS App provides an auction platform for seats in which passengers can bet on seats which might offer them better surroundings.
After your boarded the aircraft you can run the app and upgrade your seat if you are fast and lucky enough to be the highest bidder for the seat of your choice!

We are offering airlines the option to increase revenues in the whole consumer trajectory. SeatTreat opens up a new line of business for the time in which the airplane is in the air.
